# Job Announcement: Expert Software Architect (Core & Reliability)

**Title:** Expert Software Architect (Core & Reliability)

**Location:** 100% Remote

**About Us**

At Eulen Labs, we build products for the sovereign individual, with a focus on security, privacy, and technical excellence. We are looking for a battle-tested, hands-on architect to become the guardian of our core production systems.

**The Role**

This is not a management role. This is a deeply technical, hands-on position for a master craftsperson who prefers architecting and shipping brilliant code to attending meetings. As the technical owner of our high-volume core services, you will be the gatekeeper of quality, the champion of reliability, and the calm voice of reason during a crisis. Your mission: to ensure our systems run with unwavering stability and speed, enabling us to deploy frequently and safely.

**Who We're Looking For**

We are seeking an expert with **15+ years of software engineering experience** in critical, high-volume environments. You are a pragmatist who lives and breathes automated testing, resilient architecture, and the relentless pursuit of improvement. You have a history of leading incident responses and a passion for mentoring others through exemplary code and rigorous reviews.

**The Process & How to Apply**

Our selection process is designed to identify the best, and it moves quickly.

To apply, please send your CV and/or a link to your LinkedIn profile to **jobs@eulen.app** before **September 19th, 2025**.

All applicants will receive an email with detailed instructions for our first challenge (Phase 0) at **00:00 (BRT) on Friday, September 19th**. You will have exactly 24 hours to submit your solution, with a hard deadline at **00:00 (BRT) on Saturday, September 20th**.

**Hiring Timeline:**
*   **September 19th (Friday):** Phase 0 begins. Instructions are sent at 00:00 BRT. This first challenge (via Google Forms) must be completed within 24 hours.
*   **September 20th (Saturday):** Candidates who successfully pass Phase 0 will receive instructions for Phase 1. This next stage, consisting of cultural and logical assessments, **must be completed on this day**.
*   **September 21st (Sunday):** Successful candidates from the previous stage will receive instructions for Phase 2. This final challenge, a specific technical deep-dive, **must be completed on this day**.

Candidates who successfully complete all phases will be contacted to schedule a final interview, which may be conducted online or in person.

If you are ready to take on a role with immense impact and technical ownership, we look forward to hearing from you.
