						<h2>Be part of our team.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Welcome to <strong>Eulen</strong>! Hiring is a priority in our culture. We think about it tirelessly every day. Even when we don't have open positions, <strong>we are always looking for talents</strong> because we believe that the foundation of a good culture is having a team with a brilliant mind.</p>
					<p>
						The entire process may take a couple of hours of dedication.

						<h2>I - First phase</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The goal of the first phase is to filter out individuals who are genuinely interested in working with us. It's almost like a "captcha" for our selection process. Since hiring is a priority for us, we invest a lot of resources in it. Therefore, to avoid wasting resources on both our end and the candidate's end, this phase is necessary.</p>

					<p><strong>Follow the instructions below very carefully:</strong></p>
						<ol>
						<li><p><b>1)</b> Send an email to <a href="mailto:jobs@eulen.app">jobs@eulen.app</a> with your CV attached or a link to your LinkedIn profile. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: Don't worry too much about your resume. We will only review it in the final stage, during the interview. We have a policy that results are more important than specific experience.</span></p></li>

						<li><p><b>2)</b> You need to create an account with any client that uses the Nostr protocol. You must publicly post the phrase: "I want to work at Eulen with #DePix!" and paste the link to the post in the body of the email. &mdash; If you prefer not to publish this phrase due to opsec reasons, you may choose any other phrase.</p></li>

						<li>
						<p><b>3) Solve this riddle:</b> Fernando, Eduardo, and Felipe met in the city of Joaquim Távora, PR, at a place to have a conversation. After the meeting, Fernando walked 3.24 km to Rancho Dois Sabinos. Eduardo walked 2.35 km to R.B. Equitação, and Felipe walked 2.83 km to Bibi Bronze. Where did they initially meet?
							</p>
							<p style="font-style: italic;">
								<b>Important:</b> For simplification purposes, consider that the walk occurred in a straight line.
							</p>
							<p style="font-style: italic;">
								<b>Hint:</b> first, use Google Maps to determine the coordinates of each location. Then, use a circle intersection tool to find the final coordinate. Afterward, go back to Google Maps to identify the meeting point.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Feedback & questions</strong></p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, at this stage, we are unable to provide individual feedback to each candidate as the volume is too high. However, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

						<h2>II - Second phase</h2>
					</header>
					<p>If you made it to the second stage, consider yourself privileged. Not everyone has the patience to get this far. You will be invited to join a Telegram Group, where you will receive detailed instructions on how to proceed.</p>

					<p>Basically, you will receive a link to one or more objective tests. These are general skills tests. You may also receive a specific test depending on your area of interest.</p>

					<p>These tests will take about 30~40 minutes each and are generally intentionally challenging. But don’t worry about acing them or getting a perfect score: that’s not the goal. The aim is simply to rank the candidates so that we can have a prioritized list.</p>

					<p><strong>Feedback & questions</strong></p>

					<p>At this stage, all candidates will receive individual feedback and test results. This feedback can be useful for you to improve your skills for future tests.</p>

					<p>
						At this stage, you will be able to ask any questions about the company, if you wish. We may not always have open positions, and if that is the case, you will be informed at this stage so you can decide whether or not to continue.
					</p><p>
						Our hiring process is continuous, which means that we are always looking for talent, even when we don’t have an immediate need. If you are the gem we are looking for, you can be sure you will be given priority when a need arises.

						<h2>III - Interview</h2>
						<p>After a few tests—phew!—it’s finally time for our interview, where we can really get to know each other. Whether it's in person or over a video call, we’d love it if you could turn on your camera and mic. It makes the conversation more human, and we get to read your expressions better!</p>

						<p>In this phase, we'll ask some questions and give you a chance to clarify any doubts you have about us. Make yourself at home, and there might even be a couple of small tests (don’t worry, we’ll give you a heads-up).</p>

						<p>We usually try to give feedback during the interview itself. If something didn’t go as planned, we’ll be honest—our aim is to help you in future interviews. Not a fan of direct feedback? Just let us know.</p>

						<p>Sometimes, there might not be an immediate position available. If so, we'll keep your contact in our priority queue. And if there is a position but we can’t quite match your salary expectations, we’ll still keep your info handy in case we can revisit the offer later.</p>

						<p>Thanks for all the time and effort you’ve invested in this process. We know it’s not easy, and we totally get the internal pressure that comes with it. That’s why we’ll always do our best to keep things as comfortable and pleasant as possible for you.</p>
