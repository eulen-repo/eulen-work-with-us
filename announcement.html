        <h1>Job Announcement: Expert Software Architect (Core & Reliability)</h1>

        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Expert Software Architect (Core & Reliability)</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 100% Remote</p>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>At Eulen Labs, we build products for the sovereign individual, with a focus on security, privacy, and technical excellence. We are looking for a battle-tested, hands-on architect to become the guardian of our core production systems.</p>

        <h2>The Role</h2>
        <p>This is not a management role. This is a deeply technical, hands-on position for a master craftsperson who prefers architecting and shipping brilliant code to attending meetings. As the technical owner of our high-volume core services, you will be the gatekeeper of quality, the champion of reliability, and the calm voice of reason during a crisis. Your mission: to ensure our systems run with unwavering stability and speed, enabling us to deploy frequently and safely.</p>

        <h2>Who We're Looking For</h2>
        <p>We are seeking an expert with <strong>15+ years of software engineering experience</strong> in critical, high-volume environments. You are a pragmatist who lives and breathes automated testing, resilient architecture, and the relentless pursuit of improvement. You have a history of leading incident responses and a passion for mentoring others through exemplary code and rigorous reviews.</p>

        <h2>The Process & How to Apply</h2>
        <p>Our selection process is designed to identify the best, and it moves quickly.</p>
        <p>To apply, please send your CV and/or a link to your LinkedIn profile to <a href="mailto:jobs@eulen.app"><strong>jobs@eulen.app</strong></a> before <strong>September 19th, 2025</strong>.</p>
        <p>All applicants will receive an email with detailed instructions for our first challenge (Phase 0) at <strong>00:00 (BRT) on Friday, September 19th</strong>. You will have exactly 24 hours to submit your solution, with a hard deadline at <strong>00:00 (BRT) on Saturday, September 20th</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Hiring Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>September 19th (Friday):</strong> Phase 0 begins. Instructions are sent at 00:00 BRT. This first challenge (via Google Forms) must be completed within 24 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>September 20th (Saturday):</strong> Candidates who successfully pass Phase 0 will receive instructions for Phase 1. This next stage, consisting of cultural and logical assessments, <strong>must be completed on this day</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>September 21st (Sunday):</strong> Successful candidates from the previous stage will receive instructions for Phase 2. This final challenge, a specific technical deep-dive, <strong>must be completed on this day</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Candidates who successfully complete all phases will be contacted to schedule a final interview, which may be conducted online or in person.</p>

        <p class="footer">If you are ready to take on a role with immense impact and technical ownership, we look forward to hearing from you.</p>
